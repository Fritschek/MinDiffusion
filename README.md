This is mainly a personal minimal implementation of the diffusion model principle of the DDPM model to get a thorough understanding.
I'll update this to include some newer refinements like DDIM.

The code is based on https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion and https://github.com/acids-ircam/diffusion_models.

Comments are appreciated.

I've added slides for a tutorial that was given at ICMLCN 2024: https://icmlcn2024.ieee-icmlcn.org/program/tutorials#tut-7.
The slides were done and presented by [Muah Kim](https://github.com/muahkim).
