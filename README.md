This is mainly a personal minimal implementation of the diffusion model principle of the DDPM model to get a thorough understanding.
I'll probably update this to include some of the newer refinements like DDIM.

The code is based on https://github.com/hojonathanho/diffusion and https://github.com/acids-ircam/diffusion_models.

Comments are appreciated.
